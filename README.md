A demo of pointer semantics in C/C++

I once knew a pithy little saying comparing programming to soap-carving,
that went something like this:

"Programming in Basic is like carving a bar of soap with a plastic butter
knife: crude, coarse results, but little chance of hurting yourself. Writing
C/C++ is like carving soap with a double-edged razor: the work is quick and
precise, but you need to know exactly what you're doing or you're going to
end up with bloody fingers."

Pointers are the reason why.
